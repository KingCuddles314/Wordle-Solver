# Wordle-Solver
A Brute Force Wordle-Solver

Before you can run the program, you need to run `Wordle Outcome Generator.py` (the outcome file will be about 66 MB, which was too big to upload directly to this repository).

If you use Windows, then you can remove the part at the top that says
```py
try:
    from tkmacosx import Button
except:
    pass
```
